/*

This sketch was created to better understand how to control various LEDs using an Arduino Uno.

It will run through 6 LEDs of various colours, turning them on one by one with a second delay before doing so. Will move down in a gradual motion, turning the previous
LED off after the current LED has been turned on, creating a delayed effect.
